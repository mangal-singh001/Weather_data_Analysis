🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes weather data using Python, providing valuable insights into temperature trends, humidity levels, wind speeds, and general climate patterns. The analysis is aimed at 
identifying seasonal variations, extreme weather conditions, and city-wise comparisons.



📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes weather-related observations such as:

- Date
- City
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Weather Condition



🎯 Objectives

- Analyze temperature trends over time
- Identify cities with highest/lowest temperatures
- Visualize humidity and wind speed distribution
- Detect extreme or unusual weather conditions
- Perform time-series analysis for specific locations



🔍 Key Insights

- 📊 Line plots showing temperature changes over months
- 🗺️ City-wise comparison of average weather conditions
- 🌬️ Wind speed and humidity distribution via histograms and box plots
- 🔎 Detection of days with extreme weather (e.g., storms, heatwaves)





🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
